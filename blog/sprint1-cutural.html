            Kia ora everyone, nice to meet you all. My name is Kenneth and I live in Auckland
            During my reflection and research, I decided that my three core values would be Benevolence, Power, and Security.
        </p>
        <p>
            To be well-being to others and myself included is such an important idea for understanding everyone.
            It is the key to properly communicate without any aggressive manner. Power doesn’t just mean strength and brawns
            (I didn’t choose this value out of pure cockiness XD), it is to be capable of doing something too difficult to do and being
            able to influence others in those achievements.
        </p>
        <p>
            For me, the safety of everyone is a must especially during these times, I value Security because I am precaution of my action and will
            slow down the productivity if necessary, for the protection of others. I came to Dev Academy to refine my skills and to be able to learn
            from others who are trying to achieve similar goals as me. Excited to be working with you all.
