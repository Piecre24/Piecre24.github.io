        <h2>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h2>
        <p>
            I’m looking forward to finding a career from the IT industry whatever
            it’s making software or creating AI machines. I’ve been told to have a
            creative mind, it’s one of my goals to create idea that would revolutionise
            and help improve society. I to learn how to communicate with people comprehensively
            and would like to work with them as a unit. It will motivate me to program more if I
            know a lot of people who would specialize in my pursuit.

        </p>
        <h2>A description of your own strengths and limitations</h2>
        <p>
        One of my biggest limitation is being distracted. I tend to lose focus easily and can 
        be in productive because of small interference. Biggest strength is I’ve been told is my 
        creativity, working my way through problems in multiple cases and can contribute good ideas 
        to projects.
        </p>

        <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h2>
        <p>
        I would seek help with small questions at first, because I don’t like bothering many people 
        with there work. And if they are willing, I would ask for more help.
        </p>
        <h2>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h2>
        <p>I expect more opportunity for assistance from experience programmers and maybe motivation quotes?</p>
