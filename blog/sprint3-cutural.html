        <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
        <p>
            Emotional Intelligence is how we acknowledge ourselves and other human
            problems based on their current emotions and being able to respond in a calm demeaning way.
            Being positive on EI is too able to understand people’s emotions whatever their angry, happy,
            or sad to be able to navigate through the cause of it.

        </p>
        <h2>How is it different to IQ? </h2>
        <p>
            IQ is different from EI as it is more on intellectual achievement such as a degree or winning a
            spelling bee contest. Emotional Intelligence
            improves the lack of awareness of our feelings and has the function to communicate through our
            emotions without resolving into action that might cause depravity.
        </p>
        <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
        <p>
            It is because if not taken seriously, the human will find the difficulties of communication when going
            through tragedy or misfortune events that may lead it to more catastrophic issues.
