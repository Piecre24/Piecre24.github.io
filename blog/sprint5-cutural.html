    <h2>What is your long-term goal and/or career pathway? </h2>
I would try to be adequate for a software job and see how it goes. I want to see the IT industry not just
software dev but to have a base knowledge on the system. I think Enspiral Academy can be the foundation
 on start of my IT career. 

<h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>

<p>
    Strength would be sympathy and kindness to others, usually try my best to avoid conflict with 
    others.

<h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be? </h2>

<p>My will, I think it’s gonna be an intense challenge. </p>

<h2>
    What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?
</h2>

<p>

    Refine how I speak, I feel like I need to refine my social skills more in literal in order to be understand properly. Wanting to be in the IT industry I would too able to demonstrate and understanding on how to communicate with peers and clients. 
    What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp
    I definitely expect that I would struggled on Bootcamp regardless on a programming experience. How I 
    would manage is by getting help constantly, not just by the facilitators but by my peers for help. I 
    would be able to output a productive environment by having a positive attitude and avoid negativity as
    it may rub on others and can decrease progression to work.
